        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I am a student in Bloc's Web Developer program. I have also studied several programming languages at the University of Arizona. I have experience with Python, Java, C++, html, JavaScript, and CSS. I've always had a passion for both creating and fixing things, and once I discovered programming, I instantly fell in love. Now my hobbies aren't just limited to playing video games, basketball, and reading, but also modding said video games. Nothing brings me more joy than the positive reception of my creations!</p>
